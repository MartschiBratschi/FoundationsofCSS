# Foundations of Computational Social Systems: Our Group Project Guide

This document outlines the guidelines for our four-person group project in the Foundations of Computational Social Systems course.  **Each team member is responsible for understanding and adhering to these guidelines.**

## Project Overview

This project constitutes 50% of our course grade.  We will investigate a research question related to computational social systems using data analysis, statistics, and critical interpretation.  Our project must demonstrate what we've learned in the course.

**Group Members:** Anna Behr, Mario König, Patricia Puntigam, Sophie Schmaratz

**Group Backgrounds:** We are a diverse group of interdisciplinary students between a sociological & a computational background


## Key Requirements

* **Group Size:** 4 students (maximum) with at least two distinct backgrounds.
* **Project Focus:** Empirical research question driven by a clear hypothesis, employing appropriate data and methods, and including critical reflection.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Poster Presentation:** A0 format (841 x 1190 mm), PDF submitted to Paula Nauta (nauta@student.tugraz.at) by **19.01.2025**.  **NO LATE SUBMISSIONS ACCEPTED.** 10-minute presentation + 10-minute Q&A on **28.01.2025** in **HS FSI I (FSEG054)**. **Every group member must present.**
    * **Final Report:** Maximum 10 pages (excluding references), PDF format, submitted via Teach Center by **09.02.2025**.  Must include: Motivation, Data Retrieval, Data Processing, Analysis, Conclusion, Critique.  **NO CODE OR NOTEBOOKS.**
* **Open Science (Extra Credit):** Share code and data on a public GitHub repository.


## Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:** Mario König - Oversees project timeline, task delegation, and ensures everyone contributes equally.
* **Data Lead:** Patricia Puntigam - Responsible for data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing.
* **Analysis Lead:** Anna Behr - Leads the statistical analysis and visualization of the data.
* **Writing Lead:** Sophie Schmaratz - Responsible for compiling the final report and ensuring clear, concise writing.  


**Note:** These roles are to provide structure; everyone is expected to contribute to all aspects of the project.  


## Important Dates  (End of Day)

* **02.12.2024:** Group registration on Teach Center.
* **17.12.2024:** Project guidance with Fariba (Session 1).
* **14.01.2025:** Project guidance with Fariba (Session 2).
* **19.01.2025:** **ABSOLUTE DEADLINE** for poster PDF submission to Paula Nauta.
* **28.01.2025:** Poster presentations. **Mandatory attendance. Each member presents and acts as a discussant for another group. Discussants MUST prepare questions in advance.**  
* **09.02.2025:** Final report submission.

##  Poster Presentation Guidelines

The poster must include:

0. Project Title and Group Member Names
1. Research Question and Motivation (Why is this important?)
2. Data and Methods  (Sources, processing steps)
3. Results (Key findings, visualizations)
4. Conclusion (Answer to research question, limitations)


## Report Structure (Max 10 Pages)

1. **Motivation:** Clear research question, justification, relevance to human behavior.
2. **Data Retrieval:** Data sources, APIs, collection methods.
3. **Data Processing:** Cleaning, transformation, feature engineering.
4. **Analysis:** Statistical methods, visualizations, interpretation of results.
5. **Conclusion:**  Answer the research question. Discuss the reliability of findings. **Negative or unexpected results are okay!**
6. **Critique:** Limitations, alternative explanations, potential biases.


## Grading (50% Poster, 50% Report)

* **Clarity of research question and motivation.**
* **Rigor of data analysis and interpretation.**
* **Critical reflection on methods and limitations.**
* **Quality of presentation and report writing.**
* **Active participation of all group members.**
* **(Extra Credit) Open Science practices (code/data sharing).**
* **(Extra Credit) Advanced methods or data sources.**
